# World Cup Scoreboard
## Description
World Cup Scoreboard is a simple application to manage a scoreboard, including teams playing, matches and results.
## Getting Started
### Dependencies
* Java 17
* Maven
### Installing
* You just need to do a simple ```mvn install```
### Executing program
* Simply run the main class
### Test
You can run all the test with ```mvn test``` or running Tests.class
## Notes
* I have tried not to use dependencies to keep the code as vanilla as possible, so only JUnit has been installed to perform the tests.
* I have kept the code as simple as possible to make it maintainable and extensible in an easy way.
* My approach has been to stay as close as possible to the guidelines provided in the pdf document.
* Apart from the guidelines, I have focused on making the application as robust as possible.
